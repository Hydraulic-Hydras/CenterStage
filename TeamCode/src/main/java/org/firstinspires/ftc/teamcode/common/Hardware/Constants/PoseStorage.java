     * Dear love
     * I usually don't express feelings or any emotions towards people as I fear the way I'll be treated
     * so I guess I will type it here. I am scared, it's become hard for me to put up my face and try to
     * remain calm everywhere. It's not easy. I care too much, and I don't want to let this team down and
     * neither do I wanna let myself down. I've been trying to better myself and I think I improved a
     * little bit but sometimes everything is just so overwhelming. I dont know how much time I'm gonna
     * spend here but I know that I can't be here much longer, I have a little bit of time and I have to
     * be careful with my decisions. I must make it to Houston, it's the only thing left to do. But before
     * I mention that I must say, if you ever read this which is impossible because I'm not gonna post this
     * public anywhere, I love you, I really do, I might never show it, I might never admit it to you,
     * but I really do care about you. I thought maybe this year it would be different where I can stick
     * to myself but my mom didn't raise me to stay away from the people I love. She has always encouraged
     * me to pursue things I love. This might sound extremely corny but it is the way I feel. I know that
     * I cannot be with you, but I hope and I pray that whoever walks into your life and becomes the man
     * I wanted to be, can make you happy. I know you will fall in love, I know it may not be me but as
     * long as you're happy, that's all that matters.
     *
     * I'm sorry for everything.
