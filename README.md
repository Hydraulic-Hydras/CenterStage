## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the CENTERSTAGE (2023-2024) competition season.

# 9384-CenterStage

Official code for Team 9384 Hydraulic Hydras for CenterStage written by Tea

## Installation

If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

1. Download or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/Tea505/9384-CenterStage.git`.

2. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

3. If you have trouble with multidex, enable proguard by changing `useProguard` to `true` in `build.common.gradle`.

## Getting Started

If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial) or to [Android Studio](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Android-Studio-Tutorial) afterwards.

## Documentation

1. FtcRobotController module contains a large selection of Sample OpModes (robot code examples) which can be cut and pasted into your /teamcode folder to be used as-is, or modified to suit your team's needs.

2. HydraLib is a library designed to  improve the initial programming experience for new members as well as greatly enhance the efficiency of code for veterans.

3. TeamCode is the place where all the code is written/pasted for the team

4. MeepMeep is the most fully featured path visualizer for Road Runner. It objectively supports the most features and is the only visualizer to support the trajectory sequence API and markers and is very helpful for coding trajectories.
